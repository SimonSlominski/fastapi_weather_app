## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The API is simple to use: send a GET request with the city's name, and you will receive the daily weather forecasts for the next 5 days. The forecast includes essential weather data such as minimum and maximum temperature, rain amount, wind speed, and a classification of the weather conditions (e.g., stormy, rainy, windy or sunny).

## üèÅ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following is installed to your system venv:

```
python>=3.8
fastapi
uvicorn
requests
pytest
geopy
```

### Installing

#### Step 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <repository URL>
```

#### Step 2. Running an app locally
Go to the main project directory that contains the "app" and "tests" folders and run the following command:
```
 uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 
```

#### Step 3. Test API using browser
Open the web browser. You can then access the API by sending GET requests to URLs like
```
http://localhost:8080/forecasts?city=<city_name>
